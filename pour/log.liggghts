# parameters that affect the building of pairwise neighbor lists.

# IMPORTANT NOTE: these values of stiffness (2000) and timestep (0.001)
# are used in this example file to produce a quick simulation and movie.
# More appropriate values for realistic simulations would be
# k = 2.0e5 and dt = 0.0001, as in bench/in.chute.

# The type of particle-particle interaction. Style:  (Kind of interaction: gran = frictional force between particles, hooke = kind of particle-particle interaction (Hooke's law), history = takes into account the sheer force)  (elastic constant for normal particle repulsion)  (elastic constant for tangential contact)  (damping coefficient for collisions in normal direction)  (damping coefficient for collisions in tangential direction)
